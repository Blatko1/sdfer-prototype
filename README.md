# Prototype sdfer-rs

**Transfered to [sdfer-proto](https://github.com/Blatko1/sdfer-proto)**

Just a prototype of some future repo (lib) for 3D MSDF text rendering.

Showcase of all 4 tested methods for best quality rendering MSDF fonts. 
First and last method (top and bottom) excel at rendering small fonts.
